# Analytics Tracking Implementation

This document describes the implementation of enhanced analytics tracking for the Ehsaas Jewellery platform.

## Overview

The analytics tracking system has been enhanced to include e-commerce specific metrics:
- Added to Cart events
- Checkout initiation events
- Completed orders tracking
- Conversion rate calculations

## Database Schema Changes

### Updated visitor_analytics Table

The `visitor_analytics` table has been enhanced with new columns:

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.visitor_analytics 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS added_to_cart_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS initiated_checkout_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS completed_orders_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW();
```

### New Tracking Functions

Several PostgreSQL functions have been created to facilitate tracking:

1. `get_or_create_visitor_session` - Creates or retrieves visitor session data
2. `increment_cart_additions` - Increments the cart additions counter
3. `increment_checkout_initiations` - Increments the checkout initiations counter
4. `increment_completed_orders` - Increments the completed orders counter

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Tracking

1. **Cart Additions** - Tracked in `CartContext.tsx` when items are added to cart
2. **Checkout Initiation** - Tracked in `Checkout.tsx` when the checkout page is loaded
3. **Order Completion** - Tracked in `OrderService.ts` when an order is successfully created

### Session Management

Visitor sessions are tracked using a session ID stored in localStorage. This allows tracking of user behavior across page views within the same browsing session.

### Device Detection

The system automatically detects device types (mobile, tablet, desktop) based on the user agent string.

## Analytics Dashboard

The admin analytics dashboard has been enhanced to display the new e-commerce metrics:
- Added to Cart count
- Checkout initiation count
- Completed orders count
- Conversion rate (completed orders / unique visitors)

## Database Migration

To apply these changes to your database, run the following SQL scripts in order:

1. `update_visitor_analytics_table.sql`
2. `add_ecommerce_tracking_functions.sql`

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements could include:
- Geographic tracking based on IP address
- More detailed product interaction tracking
- Real-time dashboard updates using Supabase real-time features
- Integration with external analytics platforms
